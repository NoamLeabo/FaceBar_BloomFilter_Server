# Foobar_Project

How to compile and run our Project:


JIRA explanantion:

We started by reading the exercise a few times and understanding all components.
Then we decided how to divide the project between all the teammates.
After that everyone wrote his own tasks in the Jira and we checked that all tasks were covered.
We started working on the project and everyone updated his tasks and what he was currently working on.
Every crucial step was written in the Jira so everyone could now where we are standing and what needs to be done.

TDD:

We wrote the BloomFilter in the TDD method as expected.
Our process was as followed:
1. Writing a test and failing.
2. Writing code to pass the test.
3. Refactoring to improve the code


After we finished writing the BloomFilter class we refactored it again to improve our code and make it more abstract and loose-coupled from the hash functions.
We then wrote a simple main that is running the BloomFilter and gettng inputs from the user.
Then we started to refactor the main to get OOP classes to have the MenuCommands separate form the user 
inputs and a small main function.
We then found out that our BloomFilter needs to be refactored and other files needed also to 
be changed.
We continued refactoring according to tests we made to pass all tests and have more abstract and readable code.
